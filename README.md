# Harder Recipes

Datapack, that replaces a vanilla recipes with a harder one, along with other crafting features.

### Features

#### New recipes

Currently, datapack has only added chainmail armor recipe, which is much cheaper than iron armor.

#### Slower Smelting

Furnaces, blast furnaces, smokers and campfires are 25% slower (Requires more time to smelt one item). This means, that fuels are less effective.

#### Stonecutter is more usefull

Stone blocks (Like slabs, walls, stairs etc.) can't be crafted using crafting table. Instead, you have to use stonecutter.

#### Better recipe grouping

Recipes in recipe book are more grouped. It means less pages in the book.

### Files

#### To view Resource Pack files and switch between the versions, you need to change the branch!

## Warning

***The datapack is in alpha***. So the issues may exist. I don't recommend play with it in long term world, since recipes can change.
The recipe advancements can be broken, so you might need to use /recipe give @a *
