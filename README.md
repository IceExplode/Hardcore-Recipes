# Hardcore-Recipes

Datapack, that replaces a vanilla recipes with a harder one, along with other crafting features.

### Features

#### New recipes

Currently, datapack has only added chainmail armor recipe, which is much cheaper.

#### Slower Smelting

Furnaces, blast furnaces, smokers and campfires are slower by 25% (Requires more time to smelt one item). This means, that fuels are less effective.

#### Stonecutter is more usefull

Stone items (Like slabs, walls, stairs etc.) can't be crafted using crafting table (Wood is exception). Instead, you have to use stonecutter.

#### Better recipe grouping

Recipe book will have less recipe, if unlocked all recipes, than without datapack. Thanks to the effective grouping.

## Warning

***The datapack is in alpha***. So the issues may exist. I don't recommend play with it in long term world, since recipes can change.
The recipe advancements are currently broken, so you need to use /recipe give @a *
